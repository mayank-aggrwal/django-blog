## Guidelines
---

### Create an Issue
If you want to make a contribution, whether to fix a bug, or to add a new feature, first create an issue if it doesn't already exist, outlining briefly what needs to be accomplished/fixed.

### Create a Branch
Create a branch for the contribution you are making. If some bug is to be fix or something else, come up with some descriptive yet concise name for the branch.

### Write Code
Now write your code to implement your feature. You can commit and push to the dedicated branch as often and whenever you like.
